- [Edit Resources as Table](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1479)

### Style

We follow the [godot style] except for the following exceptions:

- symbols instead of words for boolean operators.
	- `&&`, `||`, and `!` are preferred to `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- we have enabled checking for types.
	- Functions must have an explicit parameter and return types.
	- Variables must be statically typed, but it can be implicit.
	- If an escape hatch is needed, look at `Node`, `Object`, and `Variant`.
