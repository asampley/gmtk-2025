# gmtk-2025
A project for the GMTK 2025 Game Jam

## Development

You will need Godot.

[Godot 4.4.1](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.4.1-stable)

### Style

We follow the godot style except for the following exceptions:

- symbols instead of words for boolean operators.
	- `&&`, `||`, and `!` are preferred to `and`, `or`, and `not`.
